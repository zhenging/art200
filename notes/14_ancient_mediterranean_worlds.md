### The Oldest Art
This Chapter focues on the region around the *Mediterranean Sea*. Begining around *3000 BC* many civilizations arose and faded into the world we know today.

**Paleolithic** - Begining around *9000 BC* and continuing over the next four thousand years, the **Paleolithic Period**, or Old Stone Age, gradually gave way to the **Neolithic**, or **New Stone Age**.
> nomadic lifestyle and hunter gatherer cultures dominated

**Neolithic** - The Neolithic is named for new types of stone tools that were developed, but these new tools were only one aspect of what is fact was a completely new way of life.

Stone Age art is fragmentary and isolated. In looking at art of the past, it is not necessarily the best art but the most preserved art that is studied.

### Mesopotamia
**Mesopotamia art** reflects a fertile land with no natural boundaries where successive waves of people conquered the region in ancient times.
+ Summerians
+ Assyyrians
+ Babylonians

1\. The **Summerians** were the first people to leave behind both artifacts and words. Lacking stone, their cities were built of sun-dried bricks.

### The Classical World: Greece and Roman
When we use the word "Classical" in connection with Western civilization, we are referring to the two cultures: *ancient Greece* and *ancient Roman*. It aesthetically indicates artwork of the highest quality and standards.

#### Greece
Greek philosophers were the first to speculate on the nature and purpose of art. Sculpture, painting, and architecture were discussed as *techne*.
+ *Techne* - things requiring a special body of knowledge and skill to make
+ *Krater* - A vessel for wine.
+ **Archaic**
+ **Classical**
+ **Hellenistic**

The **Archaic** period consist of the 6th century BC. It is the begining of characteristic Greek forms.
+ *Kouros*: Greek youth or boy.
+ *Kore*: Greek female maiden.
+ *Amphora*: Storage vessel
+ *Red-figure Style*: The ground is painted black, while figures are left in the unpainted clay color.

The Riace warriors were created during the **Classical** period of Greek art, which dates from 480 tp 323 BC. Although all ancient Greek and Roman art is broadly known as Classical, the art produced during these decades was considered by later European scholars to be the finest of the finest.
+ Athens was the culture and artistic center at this time. Athens had been built around a high hill, or **acropolis**.
> 14.25 Reconstruction of the Acropolis, Athen.

+ Greeks invented the **contrapposto** stance.
+ *Bronze* was the favored material for sculpture.

The last phase of Greek art is know as **Hellenistic** - a term that refers to the spread of Greek culture eastward through Asia Minor, Egypt, and Mesopotamia - lands that has been conquered By the Macedonian Greek Ruler Alexander the Great. It begins c. 323 BC.

The **Roman** era begins ca. *510 BC*. It overlaps the Greek era. The Romans admired Greek art and copied many of their works. Roman art tends towards *realism.*

<h4>Contour and Outline</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outline</strong> - Defines a 2-dimensional shape</li>
<li><strong>Contour</strong> - Record boundaries of 3-dimensional forms and define more specifically what shapes represent.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h4>Direction and Movement</h4>
<p>Artists use line to direct and move our eyes around a work of art.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Vertical lines</em> seem assertive, or denote growth &amp; strength.</li>
<li><em>Horizontal lines</em> appear calm.</li>
<li><em>Diagonal lines</em> are the most dramatic and imply action.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

4.9 Theodore Gericault. The Raft of the Medusa. 1818-19. Oil on canvas</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Implied Line</h4>
<p>Dotted lines and directional cues such as a finger pointing in a specific direction creating a line of sight are examples of <em>implied lines</em> in action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4.10 Jean-Antoine Watteau. The Embarkation for Cythera, 1718-19. Oil on canvas</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Shape and Mass</h3>
<p>A <strong>shape</strong> is a two-dimensional form that occupies an area with identifiable boundaries. A <strong>mass</strong> is three-dimensional form that occupies a volume of space. We speak of a mass of clay, the mass of a mountain, the masses of a work of architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Geometric and Organic</strong><br />
Shapes and masses can be divided into two broad categories of shapes and masses are <em>geometric</em> and <em>organic</em>. <em>Geometric shapes and masses</em> approximate the regular, named shaped and volumes of geometry such as square, triangle, circle, cube, pyramid, and sphere. <em>Organic shapes and masses</em> are irregular and evoke the living forms of nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Figure and Ground</strong><br />
A <strong>figure</strong> is the shape (positive) we detach and <em>focus on</em>; the <strong>ground</strong> (negative) is the surrounding visual information the figure stands out from, the <em>background</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implied Shapes</h4>
<p>Just artists use implied lines to help direct our eyes around a composition, they have used implied shaped to create a <em>sense of order</em>, so that we perceive a work of art as a <em>unified and harmonious whole</em>.</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>The fundamental purpose of light is to show us the material world. It helps us understand forms and spatial relationships.<br />
Both actual and illusionistic light are used and are important for artwork.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actual light</strong>: existing light eithe4r natural or man-made.</li>
<li><strong>Illusionistic light</strong>: the impression of light created by the artist.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implied Light: Modeling Mass in Two Dimension</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shading/Modeling</strong>: Using chiaroscuro or values to create mass.</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: Relative lightness or darkness.</li>
<li><strong>Chiaroscuro</strong>: Italian for light/dark; contrasts of light and shadow.</li>
<li><strong>Hatching</strong>: Closely spaced parallel lines.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-hatching</strong>: Parallel lines intersect like a checkerboard.</li>
<li><strong>Stippling</strong>: Dots spaced close or far apart to suggest darker or lighter areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Color</h3>
<h4>Color Theory</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Colors</strong>: Yellow, Red, Blue</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Colors</strong>: Orange, Green, Violet</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate Colors</strong> (total of 6): Also called tertiary; Mix a primary and adjacent secondary together</li>
</ul>
<p>Warm colors, Cool colors, Tint, Shade</p>
<h4>Color Properties</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hue</strong>: Name of the color</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: Relative lightness or darkness</li>
<li><strong>Intensity</strong>: (Chroma, Saturation)  Relative purity of a color</li>
</ul>
<h4>Light and Pigment</h4>
<h4>Color Harmonies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monochromatic</strong>: Variations of the same hue.</li>
<li><strong>Complementary</strong>: Hues directly opposite on the color wheel.</li>
<li><strong>Analogous</strong>: Adjacent hues on the color wheel.</li>
<li><strong>Triadic</strong>: 3 equidistant hues on the color wheel</li>
</ul>
<h4>Optical Effects of Color</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simultaneous contrast</strong>: also called an afterimage</li>
<li><strong>Pointillism</strong>: A technique of applying dots of pure color that are then mixed by our eyes to produce the illusion of color mixtures.</li>
<li><strong>Optical Color Mixture</strong>: Color that is mixed by the eyes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Emotional Effects of Color</h4>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3>Texture and Pattern</h3>
<p>Texture and pattern are the perceived surface qualities of a work of art. They can be actual or implied.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actual texture</strong>: A tactile experience.</li>
<li><strong>Implied texture</strong>: An illusionary experience.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern</strong>: Any decorative, repetitive motif or design.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Space</h3>
<h4>Three-Dimensional Space</h4>
<h4>Implied Space: Suggesting Depth in Two Dimensions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Perspective</strong><br />
The chiaroscuro technique developed by Italian artists of the 15th century also forms parts of a larger system for depicting the world. Just as Renaissance artists took note of the optical evidence of light and shadow to model rounded forms, they also developed a technique for constructing NS optically convincing space to set those forms in. This techniquem, called <strong>linear perspective</strong>, is based in the systematic application of two observation:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Forms seems to diminish in size as they recede from us.</li>
<li>Parallel lines recedinmg into the distance seem to converge, until they meet at a point on the horizon line where they disappear. This point is known as the vanishing point.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

one-point linear perspective<br />
two-point linear perspective</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4.45 The Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci, 1495-97</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreshortenting</strong><br />
For pictorial space to be consistent, the logic of linear perspective must apply to every form that recedes into the distance. includeing object and human and animal forms. This effect is called <strong>foreshortening</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>4.46 The Groom and the Witch, Hans Baldung Grien, 1540</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atmospheric Perspective</strong><br />
As objects recede into the distance they become paler, bluer, ad less distinct.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>4.48 John Frederick Kensett. Lake George. 1869. Oil on canvas</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isometric Perspective</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Time and Motion</h3>
<p>Time and motion have become increasingly important to art during the<br />
20th and 21st centuries. There is more thought and emphasis placed on the<br />
nature of time in our modern world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kinetic art</strong>: Art that actually moves.</li>

<p><strong>Driven by technological progress and rapid changes</strong>, the 19th century spawned our industrialized modern middle-class culture of mass production, mass advertising, mass consumption, and mass leisure activities such as shopping, entertainment, and visiting art museums. Art was for everyone, not dominated by church or nobility. Debates about art and wide audience caused definition of art to be questioned yielding --isms.<br />
Art museums were developed in the 19th century. <strong>First national museum</strong> was <strong>Louvre in Paris</strong>. Art just for royalty was placed on exhibit.</p>
<h3>Neoclassicism</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neoclassicism</strong> style evolved during Napoleno's empire and continued on after he fell from power. It was felt that great art could only be made from <strong>greate subject</strong> matter like <strong>history</strong> and <strong>Bible</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Neoclassicism</strong> is characterized by <strong>clear contours</strong>, <strong>clean colors</strong>, and <strong>precise draftmanship</strong>.</li>
<li>The foremose Neoclassical painters were <strong>David</strong> (Napoleon's official painter) and <strong>Ingres</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>21.1 Jean Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Jupiter and Thetis. 1811</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Romanticism</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Romanticism</strong> artists rebelled against &quot;the Age of Reason&quot; instead urging the use of <strong>emotion</strong>, <strong>intuition</strong>, <strong>individual experience</strong>, and <strong>imagination</strong> within artwork. Not so much a style but set of attitudes.</li>
<li>These artists glorified <strong>landscapes</strong>, <strong>picturesque ruins</strong>, the struggle for liberty, and exotic cultures.</li>
<li>The work of the artists <strong>Delacroix</strong> and <strong>Goya</strong> characterize Romanticism.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>21.2 The Women of Algiers,Eugene Delacroix, 1834</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Realisim</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Realism</strong> was a reaction against both <strong>Neoclassicism</strong> and <strong>Romanticism</strong>. Artists sought to depict the everyday and the ordinary for their subjects. First movement born in 19th century.<br />
Artists were trying to make the point that <strong>everyday activities</strong> were fit subjects for grand-scale art.</li>
<li><strong>Courbet</strong> was a leading Realist painter.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>21.3 A Burial at Ornans, Gustave Courbet, 1849-50</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Manet and Impressionism</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 19th century France the mark of an artist's success was acceptance into the annual juried <strong>Salon</strong>. In In 1863, the jury rejected almost 3000 submitted works. This caused the rejected artists and their supporters to mount a second official exhibition called the &quot;Salon des<br />
<strong>Refusés”</strong>.</li>
<li>A leader of the Impressionist movement was <strong>Manet</strong>. His painting, <strong>Luncheon of the Grass</strong>, is a touchstone for modern art.</li>

1. Paint modern life.<br />
2. Update 2 Renaissance image as parody.<br />
Critics outraged Thought he has trying to gain fame by shocking people. Manet focused on low and high values making figures flat. Triangular comp, inaccurate scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>Impressionism aimed to capture an <strong>&quot;impression”</strong>; artists did not want to portray a literal landscape but the <strong>sensation</strong> of a landscape.</li>
<li>The new availability of portable tubed oil colors allowed artists to paint outdoors and steam engine allowed them to travel to new locations to paint.</li>
<li>Many Impressionists concentrated on <strong>light</strong> and its <strong>transitory nature</strong>.</li>
<li>Monet, Degas, Renoir, and Morisot are other wellknown Impressionist artists.</li>

conservative forces.</p>

<ul>
<li>The leading Cubists were <strong>Picasso</strong> and Braque.</li>

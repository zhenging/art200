## 05 Principles of Design

**Composition** is the organization of the visual elements within a work of art. Artists design their compositions using guidelines known as the *Principles of Design*.

### Unity and Variety
- **Unity**: The sense of oneness, of things belonging together and makeing up a coherent whole.
- **Visual Unity**: Based on using the visual elements-shapes, lines, color, and so on.
- **Conceptual Unity**: Created through tying a group of idead together.

- **Variety**: Differences that provide interest and contrast.

### Balance
- **Visual Weight**: Refers to an apparent “heaviness” or “lightness” of forms arranged in a composition.
When visual weight is equally distributed to either side of the implied center of gravity a composition is felt to be visually balanced.

#### Symmetrical Balance
With sysmmetrical balance, the forms of a composition mirror each other accross a central axis, ans imaginary straight line that divide the composition in half. The two halves of the composition thus correspond exactly, with the axis as the center of gravity.

#### Relieved/Approximate Symmetry
Slight differences between axial areas of a work of art.

#### Asymmetrical Balance
Two sides that do not correspond to one another in size, shape, and placement.
**Principles of Asymmetrical Balance**
- A large form is visually heavier than a smaller form.
- A dark valued form is visually heavier than a lighter valued form of the same size.
- A textured form is visually heavier than a smooth form of the same size.
- A complex form is visually heavier than a simple form of the same size.
- Two or more small forms can balance a larger one.
- A smaller dark form can balance a larger light one.

### Emphasis and Subordination
Emphasis and Subordination are complementary concepts.

- Emphasis: The viewer's attention will be centered more on certain parts of the composition than on others.
- Focal point: A specific spot to which one's attention is directed.
- Subordination: A less visually interesting area.

### Scale and Proportion
Scale and Proportion both have to do with size.
- *Scale* means size in relation to a standard or "normal" size. Normal size is the size we expect something to be.
- *Proportion* refers to size relationships between parts of a whole or between two or more items perceived as a unit.
- *Hierarchical Scale*: Using size change to indicate relative importance.

- **The Golden Section**: A proportional ratio used by artists and the ancient Greeks in both architecture and other works of art.

### Rhythm
Rhythm is based in repetition and is a basic part of our world.
- **Visual Rhythm**: Depends on the repetition of accented elements, usually shapes.

Sculpture involves works of art dealing with three-dimensional space.
"In the round": Freestanding artwork that can be viewed from any angle; completed on all sides.

In **relief**, forms project from but remain attached to a background surface, meant to be viewed frontally.
+ **Low Relief** - Also called bas-relief; figures project only slightly from the background.
> 11.2 Sarcophagus lid, from the Temple of Inscriptions, Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico. Maya, late Classic period, 684 C.E. Limestone.

+ **High Relief** - Forms dramatically project from the background by generally at least half their depth.

### Methods and Materials of Sculpture
Sculpture methods covered in this chapter include:
+ Modeling (additive)
+ Assembling (additive)
+ Carving (subtractive)
+ Casting (subtractive)

1\. **Modelling** is an additive process. The sculptor begins with a framework or nothing at all and adds material until the sculpture is finished. It is a very direct method of working.
+ **Clay**, also known as **terra cotta**, is the most common modeling material.
> 11.4 Figurine of a Voluptuous Lady. Maya, Late Classic period, 700–900 C.E. Ceramic with traces of pigment

2\. **Casting** is a very indirect method of working. It involves a mold of some
kind into which liquid or semi liquid is poured and allowed to harden.
+ **Bronze** is a common casting material.
+ The **lost-wax process** is the most common method for casting. The wax original is destroyed in the process making each sculpture cast unique.
> 11.5 The Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, from Kurkihar, Bihar, Central India. Pala Dynasty, 12th century. Gilt bronze

3\. In **carving** the sculptor begins with a block of material and cuts, chips, and gouges away until the form emerges. It is a subtractive process.
+ *Wood* and *stone* are the principal materials historically used for this process.

4\. In **assembling**, individual pieces, segments, or objects are brought together to form a sculpture. It is an additive process

### The human figure in Sculpture
The Human figure is a basic subject for sculpture throughout time.
+ **Contrapposto**: Meaning counterpoise or counterbalance; sets the body in a gentle S-shaped curve that implies the potential for human motion.

### Working with Time and Place
Human beings also sculpt the landscape and specific environments. There are practical, religious, and aesthetic reasons for this type of sculpture.
+ **Earthwork**: A work of art made for a specific place using natural materials
found there, especially the earth itself.
+ **Installation**: An artist modifies a space in some way and asks us to enter, explore, and experience it.

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Styles develop as reactions, either to political, social, religious, or economic factors, or to previous styles. When studying the styles and movements, think about what other time period or movement that style is embracing or rejecting.<br />
Example: Neoclassicism embraces Classical and Renaissance art. This means it is orderly, stable, linear, and clear. It desires these aspects because of the influence of the Enlightenment that pushed away from the emotional, religious art of the Baroque and desired instead rationality and patriotism. Neoclassicism was adopted as the style for the French Revolution, as Ancient Greece’s democracy and Rome’s Republic became models for new governments.</p>
<h4>Questions to consider:</h4>
<ul>
<li>How was art in the 19 th &amp; 20 th centuries affected by war; what styles emerged? How did each of these styles take a different approach to coping with the tragedies of war?</li>
<li>How was art affected by technology, such as the invention of electricity or photography?<br />
How was art affected by the Industrial Revolution and urbanization? Think about changes in medium, techniques, and subject matter</li>
<li>How did events in the Church change the techniques and subject matter in art?</li>
</ul>

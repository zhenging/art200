**Driven by technological progress and rapid changes**, the 19th century spawned our industrialized modern middle-class culture of mass production, mass advertising, mass consumption, and mass leisure activities such as shopping, entertainment, and visiting art museums. Art was for everyone, not dominated by church or nobility. Debates about art and wide audience caused definition of art to be questioned yielding --isms.
Art museums were developed in the 19th century. **First national museum** was **Louvre in Paris**. Art just for royalty was placed on exhibit.

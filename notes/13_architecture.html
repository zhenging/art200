<h3>Structural Systems in Architecture</h3>
<h4>Load-bearing Construction</h4>
<p>Another term for load-bearing construction is &quot;stacking and piling&quot;.<br />
Load-bearing structures tend to have few and small openings (if nay) in the walls, because the method does not readily allow for support of material above avoid, such as a window opening.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe</strong>: Construction using sun-dried bricks and coated with mud plaster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13.1 Great Friday Mosque, Djenne Mali. Rebuilt 1907 in the style of a 13th-century original.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Post-and-Lintel</h4>
<p>After stacking and piling, post-and-lintel construction is the most elementary structural method, based on two uprights (the posts) supporting  a horizontal crosspiece (the <strong>lintel</strong>, or the beam).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypostyle hall</strong> - A large hall erected in post-and-lintel construction was thus a virtual forest of columns inside.</li>
<li><strong>The Greek Orders</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Doric, 700 BC - No base</li>
<li>Ionic, 600 BC - Stepped base, carved capital, volutes</li>
<li>Corinthian, 400 BC - Detailed base, carved capital as stylized bouquet of acanthus leaves</li>
</ol>
<h4>Round Arch and Vault</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>keystone, arcades</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Round arch was most fully developed by the Romans, who perfected the form in 2nd century BC.</li>
<li><strong>Barrel Vault</strong> - many arches placed flush one behind the other, creating large interior spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Groin Vault</strong> - two barrel vaults are crossed at right angles to each other.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pointed Arch and Vault</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Gothic, buttress, piers, flying buttress</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Dome</h4>
<p>A dome is a structure generally in the shape of a hemisphere or half globe. A drum is often the circular base of a domed building.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coffering</strong>: Recessions created into a ceiling which help to lessen weight.</li>
<li><strong>Oculus</strong> - An opening at the top of a domed ceiling.</li>
<li><strong>Portico</strong> - A porch extending from a building.</li>
<li><strong>Rotunda</strong> - A round building.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Corbelling</h4>
<p>Each row of stones extends slightly beyond the one below until eventually the opening is bridged; can be used in arch, vault, and dome construction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13.20 Interior of the Jain temple of Dilwara, Vimala temple, Mount Abu, South Rajasthan, India. Completed 1032.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Others</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cast-Iron Construction</li>
<li>Balloon-frame Construction</li>
<li>Suspension and Cable-Stayed Structures</li>
<li>Reinforced Concrete</li>
<li>Geodesic Domes</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Technologies, New Materials, Current Concepts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Digital Design and Fabrication</li>
<li>Fabric Architecture</li>
<li>Architecture and Community</li>
<li>Sustainability: Green Architecture</li>
</ul>

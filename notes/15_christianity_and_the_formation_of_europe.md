  2. *Nave*: Open central space
  3. *Aisles*: Passage ways
  4. *Cleretory*: Upward extension pierced with windows
  5. *Transcept*: Lengthwise extensions perpendicular to the nave. Together they form a **cross plan** for a church.
  6. *Narthex*: An entry porch into the church

2. In France, another style of art was emerging, called **Carolingian** after the emperor Charlemagne or Charles the Great. His miltary conquests eventually gave hime control over most of western Europ. In the year 800 on Christmas Day, the Pope crowned Charlemagne as the first Holy Roman Emperor.
+ **Carolingian Art** - A combination of Christian and Roman imagery and architecture.

3. Among the most important artistic products of the early products of the early Middle Ages were copies of Christian scriptures. In the days before the printing press, each book has to be copied by hand. This was completed by monks working in monasteries.
+ **Illumination** - Monks also illuminated books by furnishing them with illustrations and decorations.

### The High Middle Ages
Most of the great catherdrals were built during the Middle Ages. A majority of the art associated with this time period comes from monasteries, churches, and catherdrals. Historians divide this time into 2 periods: **Romanesque** and **Gothic**.

#### Romanesque (1050 to 1200)
+ Based on *southern styles from the old Roman Empire*.
+ Characterized by *massiveness, thick stonewalls, round arches, and barrel-vaulted ceilings*.
+ Marked by a building boom caused by the popularity of religious pilgrimages.

#### Gothic (ca. 1200 into the 15th century)
+ Inspired by early Christian writings, a powerful French abbot named Suger started the Gothic architecture style.
+ He believed that an ideal church should have certain characteristics:
  1. It should appear to **reach up to heaven**.
  2. It should have **harmonious proportions.**
  3. It should be **fillled with light**.
+ To fulfill those goals, Suger's architects responded with **pointed arches**, **ribbed vaulting**, **flying buttress**, and **stained glass windows**.
+ Sculpture in the Middle Ages was often created to embellish architecture.
+ **Tapestries** were more valued than paintings during Middle Ages.

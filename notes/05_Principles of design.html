<p><strong>Composition</strong> is the organization of the visual elements within a work of art. Artists design their compositions using guidelines known as the <em>Principles of Design</em>.</p>
<h3>Unity and Variety</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity</strong>: The sense of oneness, of things belonging together and makeing up a coherent whole.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Unity</strong>: Based on using the visual elements-shapes, lines, color, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Conceptual Unity</strong>: Created through tying a group of idead together.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>5.3 Annette Messager. Mes Voeux. 1989. Framed photographs and handwritten texts, suspended with twine.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variety</strong>: Differences that provide interest and contrast.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>5.1 Memory of Oceania,Henri Matisse. 1953.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Balance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Weight</strong>: Refers to an apparent “heaviness” or “lightness” of forms arranged in a composition.<br />
When visual weight is equally distributed to either side of the implied center of gravity a composition is felt to be visually balanced.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Symmetrical Balance</h4>
<p>With sysmmetrical balance, the forms of a composition mirror each other accross a central axis, ans imaginary straight line that divide the composition in half. The two halves of the composition thus correspond exactly, with the axis as the center of gravity.</p>
<h4>Relieved/Approximate Symmetry</h4>
<p>Slight differences between axial areas of a work of art.</p>
<h4>Asymmetrical Balance</h4>
<p>Two sides that do not correspond to one another in size, shape, and placement.<br />
<strong>Principles of Asymmetrical Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A large form is visually heavier than a smaller form.</li>
<li>A dark valued form is visually heavier than a lighter valued form of the same size.</li>
<li>A textured form is visually heavier than a smooth form of the same size.</li>
<li>A complex form is visually heavier than a simple form of the same size.</li>
<li>Two or more small forms can balance a larger one.</li>
<li>A smaller dark form can balance a larger light one.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Emphasis and Subordination</h3>
<p>Emphasis and Subordination are complementary concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis: The viewer's attention will be centered more on certain parts of the composition than on others.</li>
<li>Focal point: A specific spot to which one's attention is directed.</li>
<li>Subordination: A less visually interesting area.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scale and Proportion</h3>
<p>Scale and Proportion both have to do with size.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scale</em> means size in relation to a standard or &quot;normal&quot; size. Normal size is the size we expect something to be.</li>
<li><em>Proportion</em> refers to size relationships between parts of a whole or between two or more items perceived as a unit.</li>
<li><em>Hierarchical Scale</em>: Using size change to indicate relative importance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>5.19 A royal altar to the hand (ikegobo). Benin, 18th century. Brass</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Golden Section</strong>: A proportional ratio used by artists and the ancient Greeks in both architecture and other works of art.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rhythm</h3>
<p>Rhythm is based in repetition and is a basic part of our world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Rhythm</strong>: Depends on the repetition of accented elements, usually shapes.</li>
</ul>

### Art and Beauty

### Art and Appearances
#### Representational and abstract Art
*First Communion* is **representational**. Picasso set out to represent-that is, to present again-the visible world in such a way that we recognize a likeness. The word *representational* cover a broad range of approaches. *First Communion* is very faithful to visual experience, recording how forms are revealed by light and shadow, how bodies reflect an inner structure of bone and muscle, how fabric drapes over bodies and objects, and how gravity makes weight felt. We call this approach **naturalistic**.

> *First Communion* - Pablo Picasso (representational)
> *Seated Woman Holding a Fan* - Pablo Picasso (abstract)
> *Woman with Packages* - Louise Bourgeois (abstract)

Somewhere between *naturalism* and *abstraction* lies *stylization*. **Stylized** describes representational art that conforms to a preset style or set of conventions for depicting the world.
> Scrolling clouds were a convention in Chinese art for many centuries, appearing on embroidered robes, porcelain decoration, and paintings.
- 2.18 Bowl China, 1506-21, Porcelain painted in underglaze blue and overglaze enamels.
- 19.17 Bodhisattva Guide of Souls. Tang dynasty, late 9th century C.E. Ink and colors on silk.
- 2.19 Sultan Muhammad (attr.) The Ascent of the Prophet Muhammad, and ink on paper.

#### Nonrepresentational Art
Art does not represent or refer to the world outside of itself we call **nonrepresentational** or **nonobjective**.
> 2.20 Sonia Delaunay. Electric Prisms. 1913. Oil on canvas. 
> 2.21 Tara Donavan. Untitled (Mylar). 2011. Mylar and hot glue, site specific, dimensions variable.

#### Style
1. Terms  such as *naturalistic* and *abstract* categorize art by how it relates to the appearances of the visible world. 
2. A term that helps us to categorize art by its own appearance is **style**. **Style** refers to a distinctive, recognizable ensemble of recurring characteristics.

> Differenct styles
2.22 Kitagawa Utamaro. Hairdressing, from Twelve Types of Women's Handicraft. c. 1798-99. Polychrome woodblock print.
2.23 Edgar Degas. Nude Woman Had Her Hair Combed. c. 1886-88. Pastel on paper.
2.24 Susan Rothenberg. Maggie's Ponytail. 1993-1994. Oil on canvas

General styles fall into several categories. There are *cultural styles* (Aztec style in Meso-america), *period or historical styles* (Gothic style in Europe), and *school styles*, which are styles shared by a particular group of like-minded artists (**Impressionist style**)

### Art and Meaning
#### Form and Content

- **Form** is the physical appearance of the work, everything the eye registers about it, such as colors, shapes, and internal organization.
-  **Content** is what the work of art is about, its meaning. For representational and abstract works, content begins with the object or events the work depicts, its subject matter.

> 2.25 Henri Matisse. Piano Lesson. 1916. Oil on canvas
> 2.26 Henri Matisse. Music Lesson. 1917. Oil on canvas

#### Materials and Techniques

#### Iconography
> In 2.25 *Piano Lesson*, the teacher in the background and the candle burning low (passing of time)
**Iconography**, literally "describing images", involves identifying describing, and interpreting subject matter in art.

#### Context
Art does not happen in a vacuum. Strong ties binds a work of art to the life or its creator, to the tradition it grows from and responds to, to the audience it was made for, and to the society in which it circulated. These circumstance form the **context** of art, the personal, social, cultural, and historical setting in which it was created, received, and interpreted.

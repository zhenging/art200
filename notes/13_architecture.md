### Structural Systems in Architecture

#### Load-bearing Construction
Another term for load-bearing construction is "stacking and piling".
Load-bearing structures tend to have few and small openings (if nay) in the walls, because the method does not readily allow for support of material above avoid, such as a window opening.

**Adobe**: Construction using sun-dried bricks and coated with mud plaster.

> 13.1 Great Friday Mosque, Djenne Mali. Rebuilt 1907 in the style of a 13th-century original.

#### Post-and-Lintel
After stacking and piling, post-and-lintel construction is the most elementary structural method, based on two uprights (the posts) supporting  a horizontal crosspiece (the **lintel**, or the beam).

+ **Hypostyle hall** - A large hall erected in post-and-lintel construction was thus a virtual forest of columns inside.
+ **The Greek Orders**
1. Doric, 700 BC - No base
2. Ionic, 600 BC - Stepped base, carved capital, volutes
3. Corinthian, 400 BC - Detailed base, carved capital as stylized bouquet of acanthus leaves

#### Round Arch and Vault
>keystone, arcades

+ Round arch was most fully developed by the Romans, who perfected the form in 2nd century BC.
+ **Barrel Vault** - many arches placed flush one behind the other, creating large interior spaces.
+ **Groin Vault** - two barrel vaults are crossed at right angles to each other.

#### Pointed Arch and Vault
> Gothic, buttress, piers, flying buttress

#### Dome
A dome is a structure generally in the shape of a hemisphere or half globe. A drum is often the circular base of a domed building.

+ **Coffering**: Recessions created into a ceiling which help to lessen weight.
+ **Oculus** - An opening at the top of a domed ceiling.
+ **Portico** - A porch extending from a building.
+ **Rotunda** - A round building.

#### Corbelling
Each row of stones extends slightly beyond the one below until eventually the opening is bridged; can be used in arch, vault, and dome construction.

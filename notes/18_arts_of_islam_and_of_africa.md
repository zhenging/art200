### Arts of Islam

#### Architecture: Mosques and Palaces
_Mosque_ - One of the first requirement of Islamic rulers in new lands was a suitable place fr congregational prayer, a _mosque_ (place for bowing down).

_Kaaba_ - Symbolic center of Islamic world

_Mihrab_ and _Qibla wall_ - A worshipper entering from the courtyard and walking up this aisle would be walking toward the _mihrab_, an empty mocje set omtp the for wall. This is the _Qibla wall_, which indicates the direction of _Mecca_. Inside every moseque, a mihrab marks the Qibal wass, the wall Muslims face during prayer.

_Minaret_ - A tall slender tower, typically part of a mosque, with a balcony from which a muezzin calls Muslims to prayer.

##### Types of Mosque Architecture
1\. Hypostyle Plan (Prayer Hall)
2\. Central Plan
3\. Four-Iwan Plan
+ The _four-iwan_ mosque. Just as the hypostyle hall defined much of mosque architecture of the early Islamic period; the 11th century shows the emergence of new form: the four-iwan mosque. An iwan is a vaulted space that opens on one side to a courtyard.

+ Aniconic decoration
One of the most common misconceptions about the art of the Islamic world is that it is aniconic; that is, the art does not contain representations of humans or animals.

+ Figurative Arts
Figurative art, sometimes written as figurativism, describes artwork (particularly paintings and sculptures) that is clearly derived from real object sources and so is, by definition, representational. The term is often in contrast to abstract art.

+ Calligraphy
Muslims believe the Quran is the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. It is the earliest known book written in Arabic and played a key role in the standardisation of the Arabic language.
Both men and women could become calligraphers. They were some of the most highly regarded artists in Islamic societies. Over hundreds of years, lineages of highly skilled practitioners developed. As a result, calligraphy has a strong heritage based on the direct transmission of knowledge from one to another.

+ Arabesque
The arabesque is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines often combined with other elements.

#### Spirit Power
_Nkondi_ - Nkondi (plural varies minkondi, zinkondi, or ninkondi) are religious idols made by the Kongo people of the Congo region. Nkondi are a subclass of minkisi that are considered aggressive. The name nkondi derives from the verb -konda, meaning "to hunt" and thus nkondi means "hunter" because they can hunt down and attack wrong-doers, witches, or enemies.

_Baule Spirit Spouse_ - Baule belief holds that each person has, in addition to an earthly spouse, a spirit spouse in the Other world. If this spirit spouse is happy, all is well. But an unhappy o jealous spirit spouse may cause trouble in one's life. A remedy is to give the spirit spouse a presense in this world by commissioning a statue (called a "person of wood"). The status is made as beautiful as possible to encourage the spirit to take up residence within it, and it is placed in a household shrine and tended to with gift and small offerings.

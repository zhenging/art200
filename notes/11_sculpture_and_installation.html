<li>Working with Time and Place</li>
</ul>
<p>Sculpture involves works of art dealing with three-dimensional space.<br />
&quot;In the round&quot;: Freestanding artwork that can be viewed from any angle; completed on all sides.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11.1 Louise Bourgeois. Maman. 1999. Bronze and steel, height 30'5&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <strong>relief</strong>, forms project from but remain attached to a background surface, meant to be viewed frontally.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Relief</strong> - Also called bas-relief; figures project only slightly from the background.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>11.2 Sarcophagus lid, from the Temple of Inscriptions, Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico. Maya, late Classic period, 684 C.E. Limestone.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Relief</strong> - Forms dramatically project from the background by generally at least half their depth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>11.3 Durga Fighting the Buffalo Demon, Mahishamardini Cave, Mamallapuram, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>

<h3>Methods and Materials of Sculpture</h3>
<p>Sculpture methods covered in this chapter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modeling (additive)</li>
<li>Assembling (additive)</li>
<li>Carving (subtractive)</li>
<li>Casting (subtractive)</li>
</ul>
<p>1. <strong>Modelling</strong> is an additive process. The sculptor begins with a framework or nothing at all and adds material until the sculpture is finished. It is a very direct method of working.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clay</strong>, also known as <strong>terra cotta</strong>, is the most common modeling material.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>11.4 Figurine of a Voluptuous Lady. Maya, Late Classic period, 700â€“900 C.E. Ceramic with traces of pigment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. <strong>Casting</strong> is a very indirect method of working. It involves a mold of some<br />
kind into which liquid or semi liquid is poured and allowed to harden.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong> is a common casting material.</li>
<li>The <strong>lost-wax process</strong> is the most common method for casting. The wax original is destroyed in the process making each sculpture cast unique.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>11.5 The Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, from Kurkihar, Bihar, Central India. Pala Dynasty, 12th century. Gilt bronze</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. In <strong>carving</strong> the sculptor begins with a block of material and cuts, chips, and gouges away until the form emerges. It is a subtractive process.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wood</em> and <em>stone</em> are the principal materials historically used for this process.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. In <strong>assembling</strong>, individual pieces, segments, or objects are brought together to form a sculpture. It is an additive process</p>
<h3>The human figure in Sculpture</h3>
<p>The Human figure is a basic subject for sculpture throughout time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contrapposto</strong>: Meaning counterpoise or counterbalance; sets the body in a gentle S-shaped curve that implies the potential for human motion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Working with Time and Place</h3>
<p>Human beings also sculpt the landscape and specific environments. There are practical, religious, and aesthetic reasons for this type of sculpture.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earthwork</strong>: A work of art made for a specific place using natural materials<br />
found there, especially the earth itself.</li>
<li><strong>Installation</strong>: An artist modifies a space in some way and asks us to enter, explore, and experience it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Rise of Christianity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very little</strong> early Christina art survives. Some was preserved in underground burial chambers.</li>
<li>Early Christians borrows <strong>iconography</strong> from Greek and Roman art.</li>
<li>Early Christan churches were constructed in the style of a Roman building called <strong>basilica</strong>. It consists of an apse, nave, aisles, and clerestory

<li><em>Nave</em>: Open central space</li>
<li><em>Aisles</em>: Passage ways</li>
<li><em>Cleretory</em>: Upward extension pierced with windows</li>

</ul>
<h3>Byzantium</h3>
<ul>
<li>Byzantium rulers viewed themselves as the legitimate continuation of the Roman Empire. Byzantion artwork combines images of <strong>earthly power and splendor</strong> with ones bases in Christan Iconography.</li>
<li>A <strong>central church plan</strong> design was favored over the cross plan design. It usually consists of square with a central dome. The major axis is vertical, symbolizing earth and heaven.</li>
<li>Artwork is more flattened and abstracted.</li>
<li>Subjects express religious doctrines and beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Icon</strong> - A specific kind of image, either a portrait of a sacred or a portrayal of a sacrad event.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Early Middle Ages</h3>
<ol>
<li>The kingdoms of the early Middle Ages in Europe were occupied by descendants of migratory tribes that had traveled southward and westward across the continent during the 4th and 5th centuries.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animal style</strong> - Motifs based in animal forms used as a part of delicately made designs.</li>
<li>*<strong>Interlace</strong> - Patterns formed by intricately woven ribbons and bands.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>In France, another style of art was emerging, called <strong>Carolingian</strong> after the emperor Charlemagne or Charles the Great. His miltary conquests eventually gave hime control over most of western Europ. In the year 800 on Christmas Day, the Pope crowned Charlemagne as the first Holy Roman Emperor.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carolingian Art</strong> - A combination of Christian and Roman imagery and architecture.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Among the most important artistic products of the early products of the early Middle Ages were copies of Christian scriptures. In the days before the printing press, each book has to be copied by hand. This was completed by monks working in monasteries.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illumination</strong> - Monks also illuminated books by furnishing them with illustrations and decorations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The High Middle Ages</h3>
<p>Most of the great catherdrals were built during the Middle Ages. A majority of the art associated with this time period comes from monasteries, churches, and catherdrals. Historians divide this time into 2 periods: <strong>Romanesque</strong> and <strong>Gothic</strong>.</p>
<h4>Romanesque (1050 to 1200)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Based on <em>southern styles from the old Roman Empire</em>.</li>
<li>Characterized by <em>massiveness, thick stonewalls, round arches, and barrel-vaulted ceilings</em>.</li>
<li>Marked by a building boom caused by the popularity of religious pilgrimages.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambulatory</strong> - Latin for walkwayl an aisle around the apse</li>
<li><strong>Embroidery</strong> - A technique in which colored yarns are sewn to an existing woven background.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h4>Gothic (ca. 1200 into the 15th century)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inspired by early Christian writings, a powerful French abbot named Suger started the Gothic architecture style.</li>
<li>He believed that an ideal church should have certain characteristics:
<ol>
<li>It should appear to <strong>reach up to heaven</strong>.</li>
<li>It should have <strong>harmonious proportions.</strong></li>
<li>It should be <strong>fillled with light</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To fulfill those goals, Suger's architects responded with <strong>pointed arches</strong>, <strong>ribbed vaulting</strong>, <strong>flying buttress</strong>, and <strong>stained glass windows</strong>.</li>
<li>Sculpture in the Middle Ages was often created to embellish architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Tapestries</strong> were more valued than paintings during Middle Ages.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3>Toward the Renaissance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Contemporaries, Duccio and Giotto represent a transition from the Middle Ages style of art to the Renaisssance.</li>
<li>Both artists sought a new direction for painting - a more naturalistic and representational depiction of the physical world.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
